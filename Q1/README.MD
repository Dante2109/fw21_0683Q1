## 1. Output
The output here refers to the four url that have been passed as query parameter in the main api with port as 8008 and endpoint as numbers, so there are two cases where first, where only I pass the link http://20.244.56.144/numbers/primes and other where I pass all the other 3 sample urls but due to the time constraint of 500ms we get the same output both the times because the other 3 urls are taking time more than 500ms to respond.
